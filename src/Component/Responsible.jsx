                                Responsible trading is about exercising control over your trades and taking accountability for your actions. Trading responsibly also means acknowledging when you may not be suited for trading. Responsible traders do not go beyond their means. In other words, you should never risk funds you cannot afford to lose.
                                At buggfinance, we have established several features and guidelines to help users trade responsibly and make informed trading decisions. Here are some tips and good practices that will help you be a more responsible trader:
